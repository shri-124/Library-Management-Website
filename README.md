# Library-Management-Website
A simple website that mimics a library management system. It allows librarians to add and delete accounts along with adding and deleting books to the library. Librarian can also see all people who have a book checked out and whether the book is overdue for a return. Users can also see what books they have checked out and which books are overdue. Users can also search for books by title of book or author name.
